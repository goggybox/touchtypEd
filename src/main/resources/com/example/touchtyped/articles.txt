It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of someone or other of their daughters.
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper; when she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.
Nothing is more deceitful, said Darcy, than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast. Jane caught the word "humility"; and instantly mistrusting the meaning connected with it, asked him how he liked Lady Catherine and her daughter; but he made no answer; and took his newspaper, which gave Elizabeth a respite.
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do. Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of cheerful engagements which she then made for them in the country, were so many proofs of her eager desire of seeing them together, and how little she entertained any idea of their separation.
The interval of happiness which Elizabeth now expected to pass with her sister was short, and the brightness of the moment was rapidly fading. The charm of her early fancy was broken, and she found, as the time flew on, that every day threatened the rapid approach of that dreaded event which was to divide her from all her greatest enjoyments.
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise—if the regard spring from anything but a pure and unchangeable inclination—if it be founded on views of advantage or fear of disgrace—it will not stand the test of inquiry. And in the midst of all that is solemn and important in life, we find ourselves trifling.
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every one of them determined on leaving Netherfield for town as soon as possible; but Elizabeth made no attempt to invite Mr. Darcy to stay or to express any regret at his going.
When Mr. Darcy spoke, his accent had none of his usual sedateness; and he repeated his sentiment so earnestly and with so much warmth that Elizabeth could hardly keep from smiling. The recollection of what had passed between them was yet fresh, and she wondered whether his seriousness arose from real tenderness or from a sense of obligation alone.
Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; I account it high time to get to sea.
Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer. Now, what sort of a chap is he—does he wear a queue? Then, stepping up in the dark, I stumbled against his hammock; it come to an ankle in my shin, and I fell to the floor. Gracious, was that a great start! I looked about me, but the harpooneer's monstrous figure loomed only faintly in the watery gloom.
Queequeg was a native of Kokovoko, an island far away to the West and South. It is not down in any map; true places never are. When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands, he had voluntarily shipped on board a whaler; this was his first voyage to the Christian lands; yet now, behold him at home in all seas, and at all stations, afloat or ashore.
In old times, good days, Lamed Vav, thou knowest how we parted that day. The parted sun, seen from the parted waters, parted as parted hearts. In that hour of lonely feeling, I saw in Queequeg a noble soul, quaint and thoughtful, making me wonder if all men might not be knit together in brotherhood by some invisible cords of nature or of heaven.
A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's quenchless feud seemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken vows of violence and revenge. For all his old age, his iron-gray hair, and for all his one leg, Captain Ahab has that magnetism about him which draws you to him in defiance of all reason.
It was in the midst of the tumult of the boat's crew that I saw the fleeting shadow of the monstrous White Whale beneath the surface. His aspect seemed swifter than the sea-hawk's dive, and more elusive than the morning's first breath of wind. A moment later, we were swept along in the swirl of the rolling ocean, uncertain whether we pursued a phantom or a living leviathan.
Starbuck, the chief mate, was a thoughtful man; he was a Quaker by birth, devout, conscientious, and slenderly endowed with that commanding faculty of his superiors. He seemed to see in Ahab's vengeance a dreadful madness. Yet though opposing it in his heart, he was powerless to resist the captain's iron will, for loyalty and fear were warring within him.
Each silent sailor eyed the vast whiteness with a mixture of awe and dread; it was not fear of a mere creature, but of an embodiment of nature's most inscrutable forms. Some said this whale was ubiquitous, haunting the seas in many places at the same time. Others insisted it was immortal, that no harpoon could ever pierce its hide. In Moby Dick they saw a living legend.
The night was thick with stars, the deck glistening with stray sprays of the ocean. Ahab stood at the prow, eyes fixed on the horizon as if searching the darkness for that pale spout. Below decks, the men whispered stories of old whaling lore, half in dread, half in excitement, for they knew that if Moby Dick was near, destiny itself might be shaped by the harpoons of the Pequod.
Death, glorious death, or triumphant success: these were the two extremes the crew now faced. Ahab, twisting the hemp of his new line, swore that no mortal hand would unbind him from his great pursuit. Even nature seemed to hold its breath; the seas were unnaturally calm. Every man, from the cabin boy to the mates, felt the vibration of fate in the very boards of the ship.
To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind.
I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. "I was afraid that you were engaged," said I, as I entered. "So I am," he answered gravely. "But you may stay here, my friend, for you can be of assistance."
Holmes seldom laughed, but he chuckled upon occasions. While he was silent, the processes of his reasoning were invisible to me; and it was only when he had reached a conclusion that it suddenly dawned upon me how he had arrived there. Some day, I thought, I will unravel the method by which he acquires his results, but the attainment is beyond my reach at present.
Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Never was this more clearly illustrated than in the matter of the well-known troglodyte in the swampy suburbs, whose cunning plan to entrap his rival ended only in his own ignominious capture by Holmes's swift deduction and calm nerve.
Sherlock Holmes was a man who seldom took exercise for its own sake. He would, however, insist upon it when engaged upon a case, claiming it to be vital for keeping his mental faculties acute. We walked for hours through the fog-shrouded streets of London, he with his keen eyes darting from face to face, from clue to clue, while I trotted faithfully at his side.
One morning, as I entered our sitting-room at Baker Street, I found Holmes leaning over the table, examining with a powerful lens a small piece of muddy cloth. Without looking up, he exclaimed, "This, my dear Watson, was dropped by someone in quite a hurry. Note the torn edge, the peculiar stain here—an unusual mixture of clay and iron filings. We have a story to unravel."
There are in this world certain persons, seldom encountered, whose knowledge seems to border on the supernatural. Sherlock Holmes was one such person. He could detect in a single glance the entire life history of a stranger by the angle of his hat brim, or the ink smudges on his cuffs. This gift, he always insisted, was not magic but observation combined with deduction.
Our midnight adventure in the old manor was one of the strangest episodes I ever witnessed. Holmes had insisted we hide behind the dusty draperies of the drawing room. For hours we heard nothing but the ticking of a longcase clock. Suddenly, a figure in the moonlight crept across the floor. Holmes gripped my arm. "Steady, Watson," he whispered, "observe before you act."
It was a biting January morning, the kind that chills the marrow of one's bones. Yet Holmes rushed out, coat flapping, as though the frost itself would melt before the heat of his determination. A telegram had arrived from Inspector Lestrade. A vital clue was discovered in a remote corner of the East End. "Come, Watson," Holmes cried, "the game's afoot!"
Whenever people asked Holmes if he was gifted with some mystical foresight, he would respond with polite derision. "I never guess," he would say with a slight smile. "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts." And so he carried on, seeking truth with unerring precision.
"Tom!" No answer. "Tom!" Still no answer. "What's gone with that boy, I wonder? You, TOM!" The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy. Tom was a glittering hero once more—the pet of the old, the envy of the young.
Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but alacrity in his heart. And while the late steamer "Big Missouri" worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while.
He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy well though—and loathed him. Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a grown man's are to a grown man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time.
Tom was a glittering hero once more—the pet of the old, the envy of the young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging. As usual, the fickle unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before.
Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to "whistle her down the wind," but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father's house nights and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an interest in war, or piracy, or buried treasure.
The Widow Douglas put Huck to bed, tired and happy. In the morning, she gave him a home. All day he lay in bed and reveled in delicious peace and comfort, and in the sense of being out of danger, safe under the Widow's roof. Tom came to see him, and the two put in the day planning a new raid on the "cave of wonders," as they called their haunt.
Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was under the Widow Douglas's protection introduced him into society—no, dragged him into it, and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The Widow's servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had a good deal of starch in them.
Tom recounted in detail the splendid history of the cave, with its passages of gloom, its precious stash of gold coins, and the sense of being lost that set every nerve on edge. Huck listened eagerly, a shadow of longing on his face. For the life in the open, free from rules, was slipping through his fingers. Society pressed in on every side.
Sid pointed out many a shortcoming in Tom's heroism, which annoyed Aunt Polly and incensed Mary. It seemed that for every shining deed Tom performed, Sid could find some angle that made it less praiseworthy. But Tom, too happy and full of new adventures in his head, merely shrugged at Sid's jibes and turned his attention to the next grand plan.
With the treasure found and fame assured, Tom felt both elation and restlessness. Stories of pirates, robbers, and the wild frontier still fired his imagination. He and Huck whispered about the next escapade, for the small town horizon seemed too narrow now. In the hush of twilight, they confided in each other that the wide Mississippi might yet lead them to undiscovered wonders.
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. "Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had." I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me.
Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men. My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. They are something of a clan.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.
He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.
Every Friday, five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday, these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's thumb.
In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. The lights grew brighter as the earth lurched away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and dancing has begun between the gleaming couples. Laughter is easier, minute by minute, spilled with prodigality.
Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it—in a way contralto voices have—and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.
Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. And one fine morning—so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. That was his dream, shimmering just beyond the horizon.
There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way.
"Can't repeat the past?" he cried incredulously. "Why of course you can!" He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand. "I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before," he said, nodding determinedly. The tension in his voice betrayed the desperate undercurrent of longing.
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. The cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-of-door exercise was now out of the question. I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons; dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes.
John Reed's feelings and illusions were not susceptible of any change; his wish for power was not buoyed up by any airy, gracious hope of future peace. It was with a secret anguish that I perceived how the basis of his existence was altogether rotten, how he would fearfully squander a life that might have been otherwise spent in the promotion of the happiness of others.
I was a discord at Gateshead Hall; I was like nobody there; I had nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them. They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathize with one amongst them—a heterogeneous thing.
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather out of myself, as the French would say. I was conscious that a moment's mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties.
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I could not answer the ceaseless inward question—why I thus suffered; now at the distance of—I will not say how many years—I see it clearly.
Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh.
I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure. I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these aspirations and these regrets?
Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine. Even for me, day brightened, moment by moment. With my share of adversity, I was content. My occupations with the children of the manor gave me cheer; my secret thoughts lent me solace, for I found a quiet strength welling inside that carried me forward in the darkest moments.
I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you. I do not want to think of you ever more. I told you I could not bear it, and now I must forget you, I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange scenes.
Wherever you are is my home—my only home. Yet I often wish I had not met you: I wish I were independent of you; that I could be always alone. Yet how can I forsake what has so taken hold of my heart? Life is a voyage, and I feel your presence is the compass by which I steer, whether I will or no.
You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, if you listen patiently to the whole narration, you may deduce an apt moral from my tale.
The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember. When I was young, it was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn.
It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me. The rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open.
How delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his watery eyes seemed of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set.
I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous. I ventured into the woods, overcome with weariness, and lingered near the huts of men, though I knew not how they would regard my appearance. Nature's kindness was all I had known, for humankind was, as yet, a fearful unknown.
I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?
I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth. When I looked around, I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster?
The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the bleak sky is kind to me; for you, my creator, detest and spurn me. You are my father, my father in darkness, and yet you condemn me to wretchedness.
Yet you, my creator, detest me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear. A frightful fiend doth close behind me tread, and I must become a scourge where once I only sought acceptance.
Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Peace, peace—learn my miseries, and do not seek to increase your own. For every spark of knowledge carries with it a measure of sorrow when it transcends the bounds of understanding.
A throng of bearded men, in sad-colored garments, and gray, steeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods, and others bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice. The door of which was heavily timbered with oak, studded with iron spikes. The founders of a new colony, whatever Utopia of human virtue they might project, had invariably recognized it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery.
Hester Prynne went one day to the mansion of Governor Bellingham. It was a large wooden house, built in a fashion that betokened better days. Pearl, that wild and flitting little elf, danced around her mother like a creature of the air, flitting in sunshine and shadow. In her bright, rich garments, she looked more like a spirit than a mortal child.
She had wandered, without rule or guidance, into a moral wilderness. The scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread. She cast away the fragments of a broken chain. The world's law was no law for her mind. It was an age in which the human intellect, newly emancipated, had taken a more active and a wider range than for many centuries before.
In a moment, however, wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another, she took the baby on her arm, and with a burning blush, and yet a haughty smile, and a glance that would not be abashed, looked around at her townspeople and neighbors. She seemed conscious, indeed, that whatever sympathy she might expect lay in the larger and warmer heart of the multitude.
Pearl's rich and luxuriant beauty, a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints, a bright complexion, eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow, and hair already of a deep, glossy brown, turned away the children's laughter; they gazed awestruck at her strange, elf-like ways. She seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment.
It was whispered by those who peered after her that the scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passage-way of the interior. Her attire, which indeed, she had wrought for the occasion in prison, made a strange contrast with her complexion and mien—a bright richness of hue, much like a blazing torch.
Hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence of the plainest and most essential kind. She wore the scarlet letter openly upon her bosom. The townspeople, who had been of her former acquaintance, thought much and often of her. She, who had once been innocent and beloved, had become the object of severe and universal observation.
The physician spoke, and Hester recognized a calm, severe composure in his mien that chilled her to the heart. He had now advanced so far as to assume the responsibility of her soul. Chillingworth, he was named, a man whose quiet craft and purpose overshadowed the fragile peace Hester had carved for herself.
She had wandered, by her own free will, into the forest, whose moral gloom had become part of her existence. Pearl skipped lightly from tree to tree. As the light of the setting sun caught her shining hair, she seemed more a forest sprite than a child of mortal father and mother. Hester, weighed down by her letter, looked on in mingled sorrow and fondness.
Dimmesdale's secret guilt gnawed at him, an unceasing burden that corroded his spirit day by day. He would climb upon the scaffold at night, in the dead hush, as if in silent confession. Yet the day brought him back to his timid resignation. The scarlet letter burned on Hester's breast, but a fiercer fire consumed Dimmesdale's heart.
3 May. Bistritz. Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Budapest seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train, and the little I could walk through the streets. We are leaving for Bistritz tomorrow, and I feel anxious for the journey.
As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which do what I would, I could not conceal. The Count's eyes gleamed with a dreadful, demonic fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat.
I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I went to sleep. On the table beside the bed was a little silver crucifix. The lamp was still burning, and by its light I saw that the shutters were open and the heavy curtains drawn back. I recognized the Count's handiwork, for from the courtyard below rose the howling of wolves.
I suppose one ought to pity anything so hunted as the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not human—not even beast. It is as though some deadly serpent had crawled into the bosom of the house, leaving a trail of slime behind it. My mind still whirls round the events of these last days; I can hardly think straight.
Sleep has no place it can call its own. I am weary with dread, watching day and night, hardly daring to let my eyelids close. The memories of what happened in that crypt, the sight of the Count's face, etched in moonlight with a malicious cunning, return to me every time I let my mind wander.
Van Helsing rose up, his face stern with resolve. "We have learned something—much! It is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequences to follow. But it is the right thing to do. If the powers of darkness hold sway here, we must break them. So let it be done, for the sake of the living, and of the dead."
I have placed the Crucifix over Lucy's bed; I do not dare to remove it. All day she lies pale as death itself, rising only to meet the languor of another night's vigil. The windows are closed, the door locked and watched. Yet something intangible, some dreadful presence, seems to hover beyond the pane, waiting.
At times she raves in her fever, whispering of red eyes in the darkness, of a flapping sound against the window, of a pale figure that hovers by her bedside. She clutches at her throat, as though fending off a phantom's embrace. The physicians find no cause for her malady, but we suspect the Count's influence even from afar.
God help us all! If Lucy's affliction is what we fear, then we must summon all courage to save her from a fate worse than death. Van Helsing says the signs are too plain—the small wounds at her throat, the decline by night, the unholy horror in her eyes when roused at dusk. I dread what must come next in this dreadful game.
With trembling hands, we forced open the coffin lid under the moonlight. Lucy lay there—tranquil, as if in sleep. Yet there was a horror beneath that calm. Her lips were crimson with fresh blood. No living mortal can describe the hush of that moment, the dreadful hush when we realized the extent of the evil that had claimed her.
It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big grey nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs.
He was called Mowgli the Frog because he was hairless, and his skin was brown, and he had no tail, and was so small. The name stuck, though he had been brought into the pack under the leadership of Akela, the great lone wolf. Baloo, the sleepy brown bear, taught him the Law of the Jungle. Bagheera, the cunning panther, also befriended him.
The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason, forbids every beast to eat Man except when he is teaching his children to kill. Mowgli was safe from direct attack, but the monkeys, called the Bandar-log, were a lawless tribe, and they teased him for his hairless body and clever human tricks.
Bagheera once said to Mowgli, "Little Brother, I will not call thee Man-cub again. The Jungle is large, but thou art too cunning for it. Remember, fear walks behind thee always, as thy shadow. The day thou forgettest fear, the Jungle forgets thee." Mowgli never quite understood, but he could feel the hidden caution in the panther's words.
Kaa the python, wise and ancient, seldom meddled with the affairs of others. But when the Bandar-log carried Mowgli away, Kaa stirred from his slumber. "I have no gifts, but I owe Baloo a favor. Let the monkeys learn to respect the old ones." And so, with silent glides through the treetops, Kaa joined Bagheera and Baloo on a stealthy mission.
The Cold Lairs were old ruins half-sunken in the jungle. There the Bandar-log screeched and chattered, thinking themselves mighty with their stolen trifles. Mowgli was captured, but he did not fear them. He waited, knowing Baloo would not abandon him. The night was thick with monkey cries, until a sudden hush spread like a ripple among the crumbling walls.
Kaa's Dance is something no eye sees and remains unbewitched. In the moonlit courtyard, he began his slow, hypnotic sway, scales glittering with ancient power. The Bandar-log found themselves unable to turn away. One by one, they fell under his thrall. Mowgli watched in amazement as the monkeys' wild chatter turned to dull, entranced murmurs.
Having rescued Mowgli, Baloo scolded him in a fatherly tone, "Thou art a Man-cub. The Jungle is not always thine to command, but thou must learn to live in it." Bagheera, licking a scratch on his shoulder, merely purred, "Next time, be less quick to show the Bandar-log how to tie knots, little frog." Mowgli laughed; he was with his true friends again.
With time, Mowgli grew older and sensed an unrest in his heart. He felt drawn to the villages of men, though he loved his wolf-brothers and the wise beasts of the forest. "The call of the pack is strong, but the call of your own blood is stronger," Akela said softly. "Go and see if Man's world is truly yours, or if the Jungle alone can claim you."
Standing at the edge of the clearing, Mowgli watched the smoky huts and listened to the unfamiliar voices. His heart pounded—was he to join them or stay forever in the wild? He remembered the nights under the moon, the lessons of Baloo, the guidance of Bagheera, and the companionship of his wolf family. With a deep breath, he stepped toward the village, uncertain yet unafraid.
